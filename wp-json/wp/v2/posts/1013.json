Think ahead, foreseeing possible problems that will occur and solve them before they arrive are key qualities for this job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, I do receive calls from clients at the middle of the night, making enquiries about their tickets.<br>Requesting to know a detail or two regarding the information on their tickets.<br>Some others will read a document or two attached to their visa and call the agency requesting for clarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an every day occurrence for first time travelers to call and ask a thousands questions and one must be kind and patient enough to answer them.<br>I have awoken up from sleep several times just to attend to an immediate need of a client.<br>Owing to the fact that this business is a vast one, done internationally, the location of the client and the time of call differs. Someone could call from Thailand, it would be night to you while its his morning and vice versa\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, I would seat them down, write for them things I know about each country and how to safely navigate their immigration without issues.<br>As casual as this might seem, these information given is in line with the proper requirements and travel documents necessary for their travel.<br>A missing document can ruin ones travel dream even after visa have been issued .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about flight ticket, we take our time to study each country and the airlines that are permitted to fly into the client&#8217;s designated country without issues.<br>Without a proper study, one could book a ticket and pay for it, only to discover that the client can&#8217;t board with the airline to his designated country.<br>In situations like this, an agent must pay attention to every detail to avoid a single mistake which can ruin client&#8217;s travel dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s for this reason I did a detailed article for first time travelers to ensure they have the basic information and knowledge necessary for their journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, I would sit with a note and pen, assumed myself to be a first time traveler , think up all the possible hurdle and barriers one could face.<br>And, one after another, I would write them out and provide all necessary solutions to them.<br>Articulating them the best way I can, putting the first timers in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, some clients could be old and experienced travelers , which means they know the ABC of traveling and probably what is expected of them.<br>However, in this post covid era, a traveller may not fully know the process and procedures that will ensure a successful journey. Though he\/she has experience, the agent must be there for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In nutshell,  an agent must be there for the clients, inspire and despite. This comes with a lot of responsibilities and sacrifices but you must decide to serve your clients properly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Running a travel company isn&#8217;t a child&#8217;s play.
